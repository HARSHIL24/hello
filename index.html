dplyr
Functions
•	select(): select variables
•	filter(): filter by criteria
o	also see slice()
•	group_by(): groups by categorical levels
•	arrange(): order data
•	mutate():
o	also see transmute()
•	summarise(): summary output
•	sample_n() and sample_frac()
•	join(): joining two dataframes (similar to joins in SQL)

joins
1.	inner_join(x, y)
•	all rows from x where there are matching values in y
•	ALL columns from x AND y
•	if there are multiple matches between x and y
o	all combination of the matches are returned
library(readr)

flavors <- read_csv("./data/icecream_flavors.csv")
flavors

brands <- read_csv("./data/icecream_brands.csv")
brands

inner_join(flavors, brands)
1.	semi_join(x, y)
•	all rows from x where there are matching values in y
•	only columns from x
•	won't return duplicate rows
semi_join(flavors, brands)
1.	left_join(x, y)
•	all rows from x
•	ALL columns from x AND y
•	all combination of matches
left_join(flavors, brands)
1.	anti_join(x, y)
•	all rows from x where NO matching values in y
•	only columns from x
anti_join(flavors, brands)
